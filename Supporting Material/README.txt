2) Software and installation:

All applications are free to use and simple to download.
(local environment is Windows 10 x64)

BPMN files (.bpmn) are opened using Camunda Modeler:
	Download link: https://camunda.com/download/modeler/
	Installation notes are stated on the same webpage.

USE specification files (.use) are executed using UML-based Specification Environment:
	Download link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/useocl/
	Documentation page: https://useocl.sourceforge.net/w/index.php/Main_Page
	USE should work on systems with installed JDK.
	(More on the "Download" section of the documentation page)
	
UML diagrams (.uml) can be opened with WhiteStarUML:
	Download link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/whitestaruml/
	As far as concerned, StarUML should also work with these files.
	There may be a few differences between the presentation of the class diagrams.

JML annotations in the source code are compiled and executed using OpenJML:
	Download link: https://www.openjml.org/downloads/
	Installation notes are presented on the page.
	Note that the plugin for Eclipse is used in this project.
	
3) Source code execution:

Using Eclipse IDE:
The source code is compiled and executed using Eclipse IDE (Oxygen).
Keep in mind that the OpenJML plugin only works with Eclipse.
JML annotations, static checks, and validation are performed with the IDE.

Using command line terminal (CMD):
Here is a link to a useful resource for more information about compiling and running the files using CMD:
	https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~eaugusti/archive/102-winter16/misc/howToCompileAndRunFromCommandLine.html
It shows the assumptions and dependencies as well as the commands to execute the Java files.

Running the main method:
Main methods are located in "_<X>_Scenario<Y>.java"
(X represents either MTS or ESI, and Y is a scenario between 1 and 10)

Example: java _ESI_Scenario1
The example shows how to execute the first ESI test scenario after compilation.

Output messages is printed on the same screen.
No output files are generated by the scenarios.
